# UART-implementation-on-FPGA üìù

## Introduction

Welcome to the UART Implementation on FPGA project! This project aims to demonstrate the integration of UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communication protocol onto an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platform. UART serves as a fundamental method for serial communication between electronic devices, enabling data transmission without requiring synchronized clocks. By implementing UART on an FPGA, this project showcases a versatile and customizable solution for enabling serial communication in various embedded systems applications. Through this project, users can gain insights into FPGA development, serial communication protocols, and practical FPGA-based system design.
